# End-to-End-SMS-Email-Spam-Classification
The SMS/Email Spam Classification project is a machine learning application that utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm to accurately classify and filter spam messages in both SMS and email formats.
With the ever-increasing volume of unsolicited and unwanted messages, this project aims to provide users with a reliable solution to efficiently identify and manage spam.

The project employs a comprehensive end-to-end website built using Stream, a popular web development framework. Through this user-friendly interface, users can easily interact with the spam classification system, making it accessible to a wide range of individuals, regardless of their technical expertise.

The Naive Bayes algorithm, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks, serves as the core model of this project. It leverages probabilistic principles to analyze the content and structure of incoming messages, making predictions about their spam or non-spam nature. By utilizing a large dataset of pre-labeled messages, the algorithm has been trained to accurately identify spam patterns and learn from various text features such as keywords, message length, and frequency of specific phrases.
